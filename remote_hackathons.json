Sure, the names sound cool, but too often they’re just surface-level. If your team uses generative AI, think about creative ways to incorporate it into your application rather than your entire backend simply being a ChatGPT-wrapped prompt. Let AI support your vision, not define it. Adding to this, we have a non-AI prize category for those who do not have any AI-powered features in their final submission."

Future of Environment   Key Points  Think creatively and push boundariesShowcase how AI can shape a better tomorrowBe bold, innovative, and let your imagination soar This is your opportunity to shape the future with AI Are you ready to embark on this incredible journey of innovation? Go forth and innovate! Future of transportation sub-challenge  Background:  As students, we face various transportation challenges daily. The main problems are unavailability, poor quality of transportation means, high costs, and inconvenient timing. But have you ever wondered what other transportation problems might arise in the future? This is where you're going to shine, partners! Objectives:   Your task is to imagine a future scenario (before the year 2050) where a problem arises in the area of transportation and create a solution that uses AI to solve that specific problem. Try to build your scenarios on credible resources like United Nations or World Bank websites etc . Please note that we have put a list that could help you. Potential Considerations:  You may (but are not required to) consider the following when creating your solution: What role could autonomous vehicles play in reshaping our cities and daily commutes? How might changing work patterns (like remote work) influence transportation demands? What new technologies might emerge that could revolutionize how we move people and goods? How could transportation systems evolve to be more inclusive and accessible to all? Future of security sub-challenge  Background:  Security is, according to the Cambridge dictionary, the protection of people, organizations, countries, etc. against a possible attack or other crime. It also means, in the context of IT, banking and the internet, the protection of information against being stolen or used wrongly or illegally. As citizens, we face various security challenges daily. The main problems are theft, moral and physical violence, rape and sexual harrassment, etc… But have you ever wondered what other security problems might arise in the future? This is where you're going to shine, partners!

If you have made it this far, you are interested in either technology, startups &amp; entrepreneurship, meeting people, learning something new or competing for a prize. CharlestonHacks HarborHack brings together people from all walks of life, from novices taking their first steps into the world of tech to experts pushing their own boundaries.    HarborHack is a free event, held in person, at the beautiful C of C's Harbor Walk facility in downtown Charleston, South Carolina on the following dates: Friday, October 18th, 5:30pm-10pm - Featured speaker, Orientation &amp; Team Formation (Harbor Walk West)Saturday October 19th, 9am-10pm - Hack Day (Harbor Walk East)Sunday, October 20th, 9am-?pm - Submission, Judging and Awards (Harborwalk West) The Challenge: TRANSFORMATION \"I was a remote worker for 15+ years and was laid off during Covid. Most of my career involved interacting with co-workers who were hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away. I realized that  I didn't know the people in the town where I live, and my work experience was in an industry that doesn't really exist in my area. Having little success in finding a new job, I decided to learn something new and took a course in XR development. Little did I know that this class would set me on a transformative path. The path led me to a large multi-day event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the Reality Hack. I immediately connected with some of the most amazing people I have ever met and was fascinated and intimidated by them. Imposter syndrome started to kick in, and I wondered if leaving my normal life for a weekend and competing in an in-person hackathon was a good idea. Team formation night was where things got serious. I spent hours at the MIT Media Lab trying to convince people to join my team and work on an application for Qualcomm's new augmented reality glasses. I wanted to turn ordinary people into actors in a giant immersive mystery. The idea was, dare I say, ambitious, especially since I wasn't a developer and would need lots of tech help to pull it off. Potential teammates came and went. I gave up several times and started to walk back to my Airbnb. It was 1am when I returned to the Media Lab, deciding that I was going to join another team and hoped I could add value in some way and not let my teammates down. When the night was over, I walked across the windy, freezing cold bridge back to Copley Square, feeling a sense of self-doubt and regret. My mind was racing, and I couldn't stop thinking about what I had gotten myself into. Why did I think I could compete in a hackathon with so little experience? Should I just take the next flight home or stay a couple more days walking around Boston, obsessing about how I didn’t have the guts to continue down this path? I didn't sleep, and in the morning, I grabbed my laptop, drank lots of coffee, and walked to the hackathon. This turned out to be one of those important decisions that you make, jumping in with both feet, not knowing where you will land. I discovered a lot about myself that day: 1) Commit to something and do whatever you can to be of service. 2) See the good in people. 3) You will be rewarded for going outside your comfort zone. 4) Truly understood the value of a team. Did we win? No. But by the time the event was over, I had made new friends and helped create something I believed in. I was not the same person that I was before this event. I was TRANSFORMED, I now knew what I had to do.\"  At HarborHack 2024, the theme is transformation. You'll be developing digital solutions that transform the way we live, while also harnessing your skills to transform yourself. This experience will change you if you let it. You must do something you have never done before.  Get started: A great first step is to take a look at the Digital Product Basics video specific to hackathons. It will help you understand how judges think and give you tips on how to prioritize your time. Contact us to request longer workshops on any topic from the video. There's even a sample pitch! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWlLHpUO78 But remember, we all started somewhere, so jump in with both feet. Great things await you! You can talk to our AI, \"Descartes\". He can help you brainstorm ideas and give you helpful advice: https://aistudio.instagram.com/ai/466259289556196/?utm_source=share"

Grid the Globe is set to occur over five (5) days, spanning Monday to Friday (10:00 till 17:00 each day), September 30 to October 4.  The contestant briefing will occur on Monday September 30 (from 10:00) at the Nanoscience building, The University of Sydney, Camperdown NSW 2050. A workshop and panel presentation by Peter McArdle, Chief Engineer for Engineers Without Borders Australia, is highly anticipated. A variety of live presentations, workshops, panels and Q&amp;A with experts will be hosted across the span of the event at the Nanoscience Lecture Theatre. All participant solutions will be submitted and heard by 14:00 on Friday 4 October, 2024. Contestant presentations will be judged on this day, with results heard by 17:00. A panel of industry professionals, university academics, and (ideally) yourselves will judge participants using a judging criteria pre-prepared. High-performing participants will be awarded a variety of prizes, presented by GDSC, EWB and volunteers. The hackathon directly calls on students to ideate and prototype telecommunications systems capable of operating under extreme conditions, ensuring reliable connectivity for isolated communities.  Get started A key aspect of the hackathon is its emphasis on sustainability and innovation; participants are urged to minimise environmental impacts and use renewable resources in their designs, aiming for solutions that are mobile, intuitive, and affordable. The hackathon also promotes cross-disciplinary collaboration, with students from varying backgrounds working together to overcome complex technological and geographical challenges. Ultimately, the combined goal is to produce tangible proof-of-concept, physical prototypical solutions that can significantly improve living conditions, economic opportunities, and community integration in remote locations. The solutions presented will be open-sourced for future development. We believe that this aligns with a humanitarian commitment to expanding connectivity and supports its interest in discovering and fostering new talent and ideas in the telecommunications sector. Presenting in this hackathon offers an opportunity to connect with innovative students dedicated to solving real-world problems through technology."

You're concerned about the November elections and want to do more than just vote You're an emerging technologist, social scientist, designer, strategist, politician, researcher or advocateYou want experience coming up with creative, tech-driven solutions to complex social challengesYou're interested in a chance to win a paid fellowship with Human Rights First's Innovation Lab   THE CHALLENGE: GAMIFYING ELECTION PROTECTION Whether you’re a Republican or Democrat, a Trump supporter, Biden supporter, or part of the exhausted majority - Americans’ confidence in our democratic institutions continues to wane, and for good reason. Unregulated campaign spending, voter suppression and partisan gerrymandering are corrupting our free and fair elections. Congress is too polarized to effectively legislate. Our information ecosystem is flooded with mis-and-disinformation, while algorithms inoculate us from diverse perspectives. Meanwhile, big tech continues to ‘move fast and break things’ at a pace that regulators can’t keep up with and at a scale that is damaging democracies around the world. This systemic dysfunction has sowed seeds of fear, uncertainty, distrust, and division that some experts argue put us at risk of increased political violence. It’s threatening our democracy as we know it, while also tearing our families and communities apart. All told, this leaves many feeling defeated, disillusioned and disempowered – rightly so.  During this election season, when the feelings of anxiety and powerlessness are at a fever pitch, we are seeking solutions that give the public an opportunity to play a more active and empowered role in protecting our elections. In doing so, we hope to unite our users around a common goal – one that transcends the differences that divide us.  This challenge is broad. To narrow the sandbox, we will ask hackathon participants to explore solutions that accomplish these larger objectives specifically by leveraging gamification. Gamification is the application of game-design elements and principles (such as badges, leaderboards, points, levels, and role-playing) in non-game contexts for the purpose of enhancing engagement and motivating behavior. Gamification has the power to rally diverse people around a common objective, to inspire action, and to inject fun and hope in unexpected places. For these reasons, we believe it is a particularly potent strategy for engaging, uniting, and re-inspiring an otherwise divided and disillusioned American public in the fight for our democracy.    GET STARTED! While the 2-day prototyping will take place on June 15-16, we encourage teams to begin developing and refining their ideas in advance. This allows for those hack days to be focused strictly on design and technical execution. That said, a more comprehensive brief will be made available to all registered participants. This will include more details and resources on the problem space and a list of potential thought-starter ideas. We will also offer office hours so that teams can receive live support and feedback from subject matter experts and Human Rights First staff.    OTHER IMPORTANT NOTES Registration for remote participation will remain open until June 15. In person registration ends June 7, 2024 at 12pm EDT (will take place at Howard University) We encourage your to work in teams! The more inter-disciplinary, the better. This is a complex challenge that requires different skillsets - both technical and non-technical. We strongly recommend that teams dedicate time in advance to define their solution given the complexity of the problem Sponsorship opportunities available now! Click here."

The internet and digital tools have created new opportunities to build a more inclusive global trade landscape. Digitally-enabled trade significantly reduces the cost of internationalization, allowing micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), women, minorities, and other groups with untapped economic potential, such as Indigenous Peoples as appropriate, people with disabilities, and those from remote and rural communities, to connect with global customers and expand beyond their home markets. In line with the 2023 APEC theme: “Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All”—which focuses on the interconnected concepts of “resiliency,” “sustainability,” and “inclusivity”—this year’s APEC App Challenge aims to enable MSMEs and other groups with untapped economic potential to seize the unprecedented opportunity to participate in global digitally-enabled trade."

We often organise outreach and extension initiatives for societal development.   ABOUT CHAT: One of the most active groups at SRMIST is CHAT (Community of Hackers and Advanced Technologists). We are particularly interested in raising awareness among consumers about cyber and technology hazards. Our group is well-versed in the latest technological advancements. The major goal is to donate our efforts to this society in order to assist them in making judicious use of technology. Our action plan involves a series of hands-on sessions with a webinar, followed by numerous activities that will let participants think outside the box and work in a group setting where they can learn from one another. CHAT is particularly interested in cyber security and other emerging technology. CHAT has over 100 members, has hosted over 20 events with an attendance of over 5000 people, has a technical blog with over 1500 subscribers, and is also building an \"anonymous crime reporting platform\" on which users may report various sorts of crime and tip-offs.

This will be like a smart home solution, but for an entire building.\n\n\n\nVehicle Maintenance: Build a mobile app that allows the owner of the vehicle to fill in timely information about the services done.Based on the input received, the app should detect what other parameters need service, when the next service is due, what parts need replacement, and so on. Furthermore, the app can also use augmented reality (AR) to help owners understand the functionality of their vehicle by simply hovering their phone camera over the different various buttons of the interior of the parts in the engine bay.\n\n\n\nFind Parking spots: Develop a smartphone app that detects available parking spots in a given area. The idea is to help drivers focus on the road and reduce their fuel consumption by quickly finding available parking. The app can also include features like speed limit warnings and speed camera warnings on highways.\n\n4. ThinkBanking(+)\n\nSubscription Management System: Consumers are increasingly using the monthly or annual subscription services of Netflix, The idea is to create a mobile app or web platform to empower consumers to better manage their payments for ongoing subscription services like Amazon, Spotify, iCloud, DropBox, and so on.The focus of this software or app should be to help detect and manage consumers’ subscriptions once they fall into disuse.\n\n\n\nCash Flow Management: The idea is to help people view and study their overall spend analysis by developing a mobile app to analyze all the purchases made by scanning a receipt. Use optical character recognition (OCR) to simply click an image of a receipt and track payments.Using AI and machine learning, the app should be able to group items category-wise, for example, food, clothes, fuel, etc. The app should prompt users when they overspend or make repeat purchases.\n\n\n\neKYC system for document management using blockchain: The typical KYC processes are generally repetitive, time-consuming, leading to high administrative overhead costs and inconsistency. The routine KYC verification is used for in-house or multi-branch usage.\n\n"

Clinicians, Carers, Consumers and Policymakers are navigating their way through the maze of technology changes + challenges, but need help sorting signal from noise, fact from fiction, progression from stasis and decay. Our Hackathon experience at the University of Newcastle will give early career exposure and cross-disciplinary design experiences to ICT, Design, Business and Health students, informed and shaped by experienced clinicians, consumers and carers on contemporary healthcare issues. Their challenge, over 54hrs, will be to design + develop 1st generation technical prototypes to address a healthcare problem with targeted use of contemporary technology. In doing so, our event attendees will develop a strong working understanding of the challenges, constraints and possibilities in an intensive crucible of health+tech curiosity.\n\nLet's work together to see what can be cooked up with the right ingredients of our 5CFocus: Care, Clinical Skills+Experience, Connectedness, Creativity and Cutting Edge technology. Our event winners will be eligible for a range of cash and in-kind incentives from local companies and Sydney technology incubators.\n\nAn Eventbrite ticket is required from https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/hacking-healthtech-tickets-21541000713, with event attendee numbers capped at 90 people to fit within our intended venue. However, we're also making remote teaming options possible, so if you want to interact from outside the Hackathon room, you'll still be able to work with embedded teams."
